#OVERVIEW
- Built a Autocomplete search using react.js and react-redux.

#Functionalities
ðŸš€ Make the autocomplete search using live Youtube autoComplete API.
ðŸš€ Manage the Api call using Debouncing in search functionality.
ðŸš€ Used Redux to manage the unnecessary api call through caching  (when user again and again search for the same keyword it will make an API call only once, and after that it  will search the keywords from the cache without making an API call again for that keyword)
